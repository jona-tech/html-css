The website is fully responsive and is adapted computer screens, laptops, tablets and mobile devices. It has been tested throughout the development in google devtools.<br><br>

There are four different media queries for sizes 1024px, 768px, 600px and 480px.
When media query for 768px activates, the border in read_more.html and index.html disappears to make room for the text on smaller devices.
When reaching media query for 480px, the navigation bar changes to a vertical list instead of horizontal.
